This file is for the sole purpose of opening the application on your local computer.

- First step: ***Download the images of weather conditions in the "images" folder in GitHub.***
- Second step: ***Open VS Code and open a seperate file for HTML, CSS, JavaScript.***
- Third step: ***Copy the HTML code from the GitHub and paste it in VS Code and save the file as index.html.***
- Fourth step: ***Copy the CSS code from the GitHub and paste it in VS Code and save the file as style.css.***
- Fifth step: ***Copy the JavaScript code from the GitHub and paste it in VS Code and save the file as index.js.***
- Sixth step: ***The images of the weather conditions should be with the respective location as you downloaded them in your local computer, 
            otherwise there will not be visualizations of the weather depending on the place which you will input.***

This is all about the SWE project.

Note (***Reference***) I have taken a specific part of the JavaScript code which contained JSON from a project called *100 days of JavaScript*

Hope you enjoy ☺️
